## Prog.kiev.ua Video Finder.

Requires [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) 3.1 or greater, Google Application Engine 1.9+, and JDK 7+ in order to run.

The application loads the spreadsheets from Google Drive and fetches data about students, following the pre-defined format. Students can enter their mobile phone number to get the video for the courses they admitted.

I used these technologies and standards:
* Google Authorization API
* Google Sheets API
* Java SE
* Java EE
* Spring MVC Framework
* JSP
* Java Mail
